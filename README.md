1. Define two arrays in your main function:
   int arrayA[5] = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25};
   int arrayB[5] = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25};

   a) Write a code to compare two arrays.
   b) Introduce a third array:
   int arrayC[3] = {6, 9, 12};
   Compare arrayA with arrayC in your code.

2. Let there be an array of numbers
   int numbers[6] = {16, 20, 14, 8, 6, 10};
   Use range based for loop to sum the values in that array.

3. A company has 12 offices. The offices have the following sales numbers stored in the sales.txt file in this repository. Write a C++ code to
   a) add those numbers into an array and display the numbers,
   b) find the total sales value for all offices,
   c) Find the average sale per office,
   d) Find the highest and lowest sales amounts.

4. Create a program with a function that accepts three arguments: an integer array, an integer size that indicates how many elements are in the array, and an integer n. The function should display all of the numbers in the array that are greater than the number n.
